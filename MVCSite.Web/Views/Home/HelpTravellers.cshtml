										We don’t choose just anyone to be a Kootour guide. We begin by looking for people who have government-issued tour guide certifications and those with years of experience as guides. Of course, we don’t want to exclude the more casual local guides that are capable of providing unique experiences and are knowledgeable in different areas. For these individuals, we perform Skype interviews to go in-depth into what they can provide travellers and verify that they are qualified to lead tours. All our tour guides are asked to provide multiple government-issued identification documents.

But don’t take our word for it, check their profiles to learn about them yourself and, if that still isn’t enough, contact them directly. They’ll be happy to tell you all about themselves and get you excited for their tours.

For this reason, we feel it’s better for all parties involved if you contact the guide through our internal messaging system. This lets everyone have a record of the things discussed, therefore helping to avoid misunderstandings and facilitating any dispute resolution. However, if you do prefer calling, you will get your guide’s number once you book so you can discuss any additional details related to the tour.

                                        Yes, it’s possible. In this case first contact the guide to ensure that he/she can accommodate the extra guest(s). Contact him/her as soon as possible, especially in the case of activities where they have to make reservations or prepare things like meals, equipment, transportation, among others. The guide will then inform us and we will send any additional travellers a link they can click to pay for the tour and join you. Please note that any additional travellers paying for the tour must be registered on Kootour first before they can pay. Neither Kootour nor our guides can guarantee that additional or last-minute travellers will be accommodated, though every attempt will be made.

However, if you feel they provided an incredible tour or offered any additional services or advice, then you can offer any tip you feel is appropriate. You should never feel forced to tip the guide nor should they be the ones to request any sort of tips directly from you. If a tour guide begins to insist on being tipped or in any way harasses you, please report this to <a href="mailto:contact@kootour.com">contact@kootour.com</a>.

                                        Each country is different and there are many things you can do to stay safe. Our best suggestion is to ask a local who knows the area, which in this case is your guide. Ask him/her to send you an email with some safety tips before you travel to the country or even while you’re already there.

                                        Please let your guide know immediately if there is anything that concerns you. While they are not going to take you to dangerous parts of your destination, they may feel more comfortable than you being locals themselves. If you would rather leave an area or take extra safety measures, just let your guide know so he/she can take action.
